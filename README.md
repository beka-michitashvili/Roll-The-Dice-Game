🎲 Roll-The-Dice-Game 🎲

This is a fun two-player game called "Roll The Dice" created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (DOM). The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points.

📜 Rules

On each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they want. Each roll's sum is added to their current score.
If the player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to 0 and it becomes the next player's turn.
A player can choose to "hold" their score, which means that their current score will be added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
The game will end as soon as one of the players reaches 100 points. That player will be declared the winner.
